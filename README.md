Deployed on Netifly: https://mirandhy.netlify.app/

Technology Used:
Sandbox to start and load dependency; VS Code; React; The News API; GitHub; Netifly to deploy; and loader dependency for app. 

App:
The News API was used for itâ€™s global News and open source for developers. Objective is to enable user to search global news based on subject or category via the search bar. 

When creating the app, I learnt how fast 100 API usage runs out. Therefore, I had stopped short in terms of overall vision. Temp data was incorporated to display when API limit is reached. However, the search bar is not functional with temp data. For class presentation, another API was obtained for functional display. 

For the future, goals are to flush out the site, and style it. Additionally, make the temp data functional if possible, and break the news into categories before searching.
